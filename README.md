# Projects
# 1. Alcohol Addiction Detection and Recovery based Application
   - Designed ecosystem-level application in Java to identify harmful patterns of alcohol consumption by using weighted average score.        - Created UI using Java Swing components
   - Generated visualization reports using JFree charts and created back-end database using DB4O
   
   
# 2. Machine Learning Based Predictions for Crime rate in Chicago
   - Performed Exploratory Data Analysis using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly libraries in Python for Crime Type, Location between years 2003- 2016
   - Performed Missing Data Analysis, Featuring Engineering, and Feature Selection using Tpot, Boruta, and Recursive feature elimination to obtain the best features for prediction.
   - Build five prediction models: - Extra Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regressor, BernoulliNB, K-Nearest Neighbor, pickled all the models and uploaded them to Amazon S3
   - Build python Flask Application which allowed single entry form with relevant features, performed predictions in Back-End using pickled models from S3 and predicted whether Arrest should be made or not
   - Predicted whether a District is safe or not, based on Crime Rate and Arrest Rate
   
   
# 3. Default Credit Card Client Analysis
   - Loaded and preprocessed the dataset using Python libraries to analyze payment trends of the client
   - Implemented predictive analysis on default credit card client and analyzed whether client would be able to pay next month payment or    not using Classification algorithm where Extra Trees Classifier gave the accuracy of 89%
   - Developed Web application using Flask for making single and bulk entries to give prediction to the user


# 4. Edgar Dataset Analysis
   - Generated the required URL using BeautifulSoup for the given year to get log file of the first day of every month and preprocessed the loaded data using Python libraries
   - Computed summary metrics, automated the pipeline by building Docker image and uploaded it to Amazon S3 bucket
